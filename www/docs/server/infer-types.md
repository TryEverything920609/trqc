It is often useful to wrap functionality of your `@trpc/client` or `@trpc/react` api within other functions. For this purpose, it's necessary to be able to infer input types and output types generated by your `@trpc/server` router.

## Inference Helpers

`@trpc/server` exports the following helper types to assist with inferring these types from the `AppRouter` exported by your `@trpc/server` router:

- `inferProcedureOutput<TProcedure>`
- `inferProcedureInput<TProcedure>`

Let's assume we have this example router:

```ts title='routers/_app.ts'
export const appRouter = t.router({
  user: t.router({
    me: t.procedure.query(() => {
      // ...
      return { id: 1, name: 'John' };
    }),
  }),
  post: t.procedure.input(z.string()).mutation(() => {
    // ...
    return post.id;
    }),
});

export type AppRouter = typeof appRouter;
```

By traversing the router object, you can infer the types of the procedures. The following example shows how to infer the types of the procedures of the example `appRouter`:

```ts title='types.ts'
import type { 
  inferProcedureOutput, 
  inferProcedureInput, 
} from '@trpc/server';
import type { AppRouter } from 'routers/_app';

export type User = inferProcedureOutput<AppRouter['user']['me']>;
//           ^? { id: number, name: string }}

export type PostInput = inferProcedureInput<AppRouter['post']>;
//           ^? string
```
